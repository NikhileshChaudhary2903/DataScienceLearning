Multiple studies of Air Quality in regions such as Turkey (Ozdamar et al. 2016) and 
several major cities in the United States (Lu et al. 2018) have found a positive link 
between high air pollution and an increase in criminal activity. Using public datasets
offered by the EPA and the City of San Francisco (and hosted on Google Cloud), we propose 
to calculate the crime levels during periods of high pollution and determine whether there is a 
correlated increase in crime. Furthermore, we will evaluate the types of crimes committed and estimate any changes
in rates of illegal activity during poor air quality periods such as wild forest fires or droughts. 
If such a pattern is observed, protection forces such as police and fireman can increase staffing during
times of high air pollution further benefiting society as a whole.
